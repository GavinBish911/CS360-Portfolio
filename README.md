Event Tracking Application

Summary of Requirements and Goals

The Event Tracking Application was developed to provide users with an intuitive and reliable way to manage events. This app addresses the need for organized event planning, timely reminders, and data persistence. Users can add, edit, view, and delete events while receiving SMS notifications for important reminders. The goal was to create a functional, user-friendly mobile app that adheres to user-centered design principles and best practices in mobile app development.

Screens and Features

To support user needs, the app includes the following key screens and features:

Login Screen: Allows users to securely log in or create an account. This ensures personalized access and secure storage of user credentials.

Event List Screen: Displays a grid of events, providing an overview of all scheduled events. This screen allows users to edit or delete specific events.

Event Detail Screen: Enables users to add or modify event details, including name, location, time, and description.

SMS Notification Feature: Sends reminders for upcoming events to ensure users stay on schedule.

The UI design focused on simplicity and accessibility. Buttons, text fields, and notifications were arranged to facilitate ease of use. Visual hierarchy and consistent layouts ensured that users could navigate the app effortlessly. These designs were successful because they kept the target user in mind, emphasizing functionality and clarity.

Approach to Coding

The coding process for this app was systematic and iterative. Key strategies included:

Modular Design: Breaking down functionality into reusable methods and components to ensure maintainability.

Database Integration: Utilizing SQLite to persist data and handle CRUD operations efficiently.

Permissions Management: Carefully implementing SMS permissions to ensure user privacy while providing critical notifications.

Testing and Debugging: Regular testing in the Android Emulator to identify and fix issues early in the development cycle.

These techniques ensured a robust development process and can be applied to future projects to enhance efficiency and quality.

Testing Process

To ensure functionality, the app was tested iteratively using the Android Emulator. Each feature was validated for both expected and edge-case scenarios. For example, CRUD operations were tested to confirm data integrity, and SMS functionality was tested to verify proper permissions handling. This process was crucial as it revealed minor bugs, such as UI inconsistencies and database indexing errors, which were promptly addressed.

Challenges and Innovation

Throughout the design and development process, challenges such as database schema adjustments and SMS permission handling required innovative solutions. For instance, validating column indices during runtime ensured that database queries did not fail due to schema mismatches. Additionally, designing a user-centered UI while maintaining backend efficiency was a balancing act that required iterative refinement.

Demonstrated Knowledge and Skills

The appâ€™s successful integration of SQLite for data persistence and the implementation of SMS notifications stand out as key demonstrations of my skills and knowledge. These components required a deep understanding of Android development practices and user experience principles. The resulting functionality and seamless user experience showcase the culmination of these efforts.

Conclusion

The Event Tracking Application represents a comprehensive approach to mobile app design and development. It demonstrates not only technical proficiency but also a commitment to user-centered design. This project has strengthened my ability to create functional, reliable, and user-friendly mobile applications.
